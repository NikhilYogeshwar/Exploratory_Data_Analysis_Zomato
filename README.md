# Zomato_Exploratory_Data_Analysis (EDA) Project

1.) Welcome to my Zomato Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project! In this project, I delve into the rich dataset provided by Zomato, one of the world's leading restaurant search and discovery platforms. Through extensive analysis, visualization, and statistical exploration.

2.) I aim to uncover fascinating insights about restaurants, cuisines, user preferences, ratings and much more. From understanding regional dining trends to evaluating restaurant ratings and pricing dynamics, this EDA project offers valuable insights for food enthusiasts, data scientists, and industry professionals alike. Dive into the world of Zomato with me and explore the flavors of data!

3.) I have performed this analysis using Python [Pandas,Numpy,Matplotlib,Seaborn] in jupyter notebooks.

4.) I have even solved few questions related to the Zomato using various codes.

5.) I have even performed few Observations on the visualizations by this data.

Please feel free to view my code and visualisations which created.

Thank You
